# Hot Reload Inside Docker

## What is Hot Relaod?

Run the application first time by clicking <img src={playIcon} width="15"/> button in __IDE__. While application is running, make some
changes to the code in `src` directory and save the changes. This time code changes
should be auto-compiled and updated without having to restart the application manually, and that is
what we call a __Hot Reload__.

<ReactPlayer playing controls url={video1}/>

## Outcomes

- Application built inside docker.
- Code changes are auto-compiled and updated without having to restart the app or container.
- Remote debugging using IntelliJIDEA.
